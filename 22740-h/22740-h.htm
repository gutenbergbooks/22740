<h2>TO LITTLE GIRLS AND BOYS.</h2>

<p>Once on a time there lived a little bit of a lady, who
had a great many nephews and nieces. She was very little
indeed, so all the children loved her, and said she was the
best little Auntie in the world, and exactly the right size
to play with them and tell them stories. Sometimes she
told them stories about great and good men; sometimes funny
stories about Frizzlefits and Rumplestiltskin, and sometimes
she would make them nearly die with laughing at stories
about the Dutchman, Hansansvanansvananderdansvaniedeneidendiesandesan.</p>

<p>At last, one day, one of her nieces said to her, "Dear
Auntie, do write some stories, and put them in a book for us
to read, and keep, as long as we live."</p>

<p>The little Aunt thought this was a very good plan, and
<em>here</em> are the stories, dear little children, for all of you. If
you like them, just let me know, and you shall have some
more next year from</p>

<h2><a name="THE_APPLE_DUMPLING">THE APPLE DUMPLING.</a></h2>


<p>Many years ago, there was a little old woman
who lived a long way off in the woods. She lived
all by herself, in a little cottage with only two
rooms in it, and she made her living by knitting
blue woollen stockings, and selling them.</p>

<p>One morning the old woman brushed up the
hearth all clean, and put everything in order;
then she went to the pantry and took out a great
black pot, and filled it full of water, and hung it
over the fire, and then she sat down in her arm-chair
by the fire. She took her spectacles out
of her pocket and put them on her nose, and began
to knit a great blue woollen stocking.</p>

<p>Very soon she said to herself, "I wonder
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
what I shall have for dinner? I think I will
make an apple dumpling." So she put her knitting
down, and took her spectacles off her nose,
and put them in her pocket, and, getting out of
her arm-chair, she went to the cupboard and got
three nice rosy-cheeked apples. Then she went
to the knife-box and got a knife; and then she
took a yellow dish from the dresser, and sat down
in her arm-chair, and began to pare the apples.</p>

<p>After she had pared the apples, she cut each
one into four quarters. Then she got up again,
and set the dish of apples on the table, and went
to the cupboard, and got some flour and a lump
of butter. Then she took a pitcher, and went
out-of-doors to a little spring of water close by,
and filled the pitcher with clear, cold water. So
she mixed up the flour and butter, and made them
into a nice paste with the water; and then she
went behind the door, and took down a rolling-pin
that was hung up by a string, and rolled out
the paste, and put the apples inside, and covered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the apples all up with the paste. "That looks
nice," said the old woman. So she tied up the
dumpling in a nice clean cloth, and put it into
the great black pot that was over the fire.</p>

<p>After she had brushed up the hearth again,
and put all the things she had used away, she sat
down in her arm-chair by the fire, and took her
spectacles out of her pocket and put them on her
nose, and began to knit the big blue woollen
stocking.</p>

<p>She knit eight times round the stocking, and
then she said to herself, "I wonder if the dumpling
is done?" So she laid down her knitting,
and took a steel fork from the mantelpiece, and
lifted the lid of the pot and looked in.</p>

<p>As she was looking in, her spectacles tumbled
off her nose, and fell into the pot.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear!&mdash;that's bad! that's
bad!" said the old woman.</p>

<p>She got the bright tongs, and fished up her
spectacles, and wiped them with the corner of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
her apron, and put them on her nose again, and
then she stuck the fork into the apple dumpling.</p>

<p>The apples were hard. "No, no, no," she
said; "it is not done yet."</p>

<p>So she put on the lid of the pot, and laid the
fork on the mantelpiece, and sat down in her
arm-chair, and began to knit again on the big
blue woollen stocking.</p>

<p>She knit six times round the stocking, and
then she said to herself, "I wonder if the dumpling
is done?"</p>

<p>So she put her knitting down, and took the
fork from the mantelpiece, and lifted the lid of
the pot and looked in.</p>

<p>As she was looking in, her spectacles tumbled
off her nose, and fell into the pot.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear!&mdash;that's bad! that's
bad!" said the old woman.</p>

<p>She got the bright tongs and fished up her
spectacles, and wiped them with the corner of
her apron, and put them on her nose again, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
took the fork and stuck it into the dumpling.
The apples were just beginning to get soft.</p>

<p>"No, no, no; it is not quite done yet," said
the old woman.</p>

<p>So she put on the lid of the pot, and laid the
fork on the mantelpiece, and sat down in her
arm-chair, and began to knit again on the big
blue woollen stocking.</p>

<p>She knit twice round the stocking, and then
she said to herself, "I wonder if the dumpling
is done?"</p>

<p>So she laid down her knitting, and took the
fork from the mantelpiece, and lifted the lid of
the pot, and looked in.</p>

<p>As she was looking in, her spectacles tumbled
off her nose, and fell into the pot.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear!&mdash;that's bad! that's
bad!" said the old woman.</p>

<p>She got the bright tongs and fished up her
spectacles, and wiped them with the corner of
her apron, and put them on her nose again,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and took the fork and stuck it into the dumpling.</p>

<p>The apples were quite soft. "Yes, yes, yes;
the dumpling is done," said the old woman.</p>

<p>So she took the dumpling out of the pot, and
untied the cloth, and turned it into a yellow dish,
and set it upon the table.</p>

<p>Then she went to the cupboard and got a
plate, and then to the knife-box and got a knife;
then she took the fork from the mantelpiece, and
drew her arm-chair close up to the table, and sat
down in it, and cut off a piece of the dumpling,
and put it on her plate.</p>

<p>It was very hot, and it smoked a great deal;
so the old woman began to blow it. She blew
very hard. As she was blowing, her spectacles
tumbled off her nose, and fell into the dumpling.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear!&mdash;that's bad! that's
bad!" said the old woman.</p>

<p>She took her spectacles out of her plate, and
wiped them with the corner of her apron, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
said to herself, "I must get a new nose. My
nose is so little, that my spectacles will not stick
on my nose."</p>

<p>So she put her spectacles into her pocket,
and began to eat the dumpling.</p>

<p>It was quite cool now. So the old woman
ate it all up, and said it was very good indeed.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BROTHERS">THE BROTHERS.</a></h2>


<p>One day Henry came bounding home from
school, his face beaming with joy. He was head
of his class, and he held fast in his hand a fine
silver medal, which had been awarded to him for
good behaviour.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said he to himself, as he ran along,
"how happy this will make my dear Mother. I
know she will kiss me; perhaps she will kiss me
five or six times, and call me her dear, dear boy.
Oh! how I love my Mother!"</p>

<p>He ran up the steps of the house where he
lived as he said this, and pulled the bell very
hard, for he was in a great hurry. His Father
opened the door. "Hush! Henry," said he,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
"come in very softly, your Mother is very
ill."</p>

<p>"My Mother! Dear Father, what is the
matter with her? May I go in to her if I will
step very softly?"</p>

<p>"No," said his Father, "you must not see
her now; you must be very still indeed. I see,
my dear boy, that you have been rewarded for
good conduct in school; I am glad that I have
so good a son. And now, Henry, I know you
love your Mother so much, that you will promise
me to be very still, and wait patiently until she is
able to see you." As he said this, he drew Henry
close to him, and smoothed down his long curling
hair, and kissed his cheek.</p>

<p>Henry threw his arms around his Father's
neck, and promised him; and then, putting away
his medal, he went softly, on tiptoe, up to his
play-room, and shutting the door, began to work
at a ship that he was rigging. He did not get
on very fast, for he could not help thinking of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
his dear Mother, and wishing he could see her.
She had hemmed all the sails of the ship for
him, and he was going to name it the "Eliza,"
after her.</p>

<p>The next morning Susan, the old nurse,
knocked very early at the door of the room
where Henry slept. "Master Henry," said she,
"what do you think happened last night?"</p>

<p>"What did?" said Henry, sitting up in the
bed; "is my Mother better?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is better," replied Susan, "but do
guess what has come. Something that you have
wished for very often. Something you can play
with, and take care of, and love more than you
love your dog Hector."</p>

<p>"Is it alive?" said Henry.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Susan, "it is alive, and in
your Mother's room."</p>

<p>"Can it be a brother&mdash;a real live brother?"
cried Henry, jumping out of bed, and running up
to Susan.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
"Yes, it is a brother&mdash;a real live brother!"
said Susan, laughing.</p>

<p>"I've got a brother! I've got a brother&mdash;a real
brother!" shouted Henry, running up and down
the room, clapping his hands, jumping over the
chairs, and making a terrible noise, for in his joy
he hardly knew what he was about.</p>

<p>"Oh, hush, Master Henry!" said Susan.
"What a crazy little fellow! your Mother is
still very ill. Now dress yourself quickly and
quietly, and you shall see your little brother."</p>

<p>Henry trembled with joy, and in his haste
he put his feet into the arms of his jacket, and
his arms into the legs of his trousers; but after a
while he managed to get them on right, and
though he washed his face and hands in a minute,
and brushed his hair with the back of the brush,
yet he did not look so bad as you might suppose.</p>

<p>He went very softly into his Mother's room.
It was darkened, and he could not see very well.
He went up to the side of the bed. His Mother
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
smiled, and said, "Come here, my son." Her
face was pale, but it had a very happy look, for
in her arms, sweetly sleeping, was the little
brother that Henry had longed for. He had a
sister, who was nearly his own age, but he had
always wished for a brother, and the brother had
come at last.</p>

<p>"Dear Mother, may I help you take care
of my little brother?" said Henry; "you know I
am strong enough to hold him. I would not let
him fall for the world."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear boy," replied his Mother; "when
he is a little older, I shall have a great deal of
comfort in trusting this dear little brother with
you. It is more necessary now than ever, my
son, that you should try always to be good, and
to set a good example before your brother. He
will be sure to do just as you do. If you are a
good boy, you will be a good man; and how
happy you will be, when you are grown up, to
think that your good example will have made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
your brother a good boy, and a good man too.
Now kiss me, and go and get your breakfast."</p>

<p>Henry kissed his Mother, and told her of his
good conduct in school, at which she was very
glad, and then stooping down, he kissed the soft
cheek of the little sleeping baby, and went gently
out of the room.</p>

<p>In a few weeks his Mother got quite well, and
Charles (that was the baby's name) began to
laugh and play with his brother. Henry was
never so happy as when he was with little Charley.
He always put him to sleep at night. The
dear little fellow would clasp his little hand tight
round one of Henry's fingers, and fall to sleep in
his bed, while his brother sang to him.</p>

<p>One day when Charles was about four years
old, he said, "Dear brother, will you ride me on
your back?" Henry was very busy just then; he
was making a bow and arrow. He looked down,
and saw a sweet little face, and two bright blue
eyes, looking at him, and saying as plainly as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
eyes could say, "Do, dear brother." So he said,
"Yes, Charley, I will, if you will help me to put
away my things." Charles ran about, and helped
Henry put his play-room in nice order, and
then climbing on his back, and holding fast to a
ribbon for a bridle, which Henry held between
his teeth, he gave him a little tap on the shoulder,
and crying, "Get up, old fellow," away they
went around the room, Henry galloping so hard,
that Charles bounced about almost as much as if
he was on a real pony.</p>

<p>"Let us go in the parlours, they are a great
deal larger," said Charles; "do, dear brother."</p>

<p>"I am afraid it would not be right," replied
Henry; "we may break something. Mother has
said that we had better never play there."</p>

<p>"But we will be so careful," said the little
boy; "we can play circus so nice. I <em>want</em> to go
in the parlour."</p>

<p>Henry's Father and Mother had gone out
riding, so he could not ask leave to play in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
parlours. He was almost sure it was wrong to go
there, but he wanted to gratify his brother; so,
promising himself to be very careful, he trotted
down stairs into the parlour, with Charles on his
back. At first he went slowly round the two
rooms, but Charles began to whip his horse and
cry, "Get up, old boy, you are getting lazy.
You shall be a race-horse. Now go faster, faster;
go round the room like lightning."</p>

<p>So round he went, fast and faster, shaking
his head, and taking great jumps, and kicking his
legs up behind, with Charley holding on, laughing
and screaming with delight, till, alas! sad to
tell, his elbow brushed against a beautiful and
costly vase, which stood upon a little table, knocked
it off, and broke it into a hundred pieces.</p>

<p>Henry stopped short, and let Charles slide
down from his back. He looked at the broken
vase, and then at his brother, and Charles
looked at Henry, and then at the pieces on the
floor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
"It is all broken," said he. "It can't be
mended at all; can it, brother?"</p>

<p>"No, it is past mending," said Henry;
"and the first thing we must do will be to tell
Mother."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said the little boy; "I am afraid
to tell her."</p>

<p>"We must never be afraid to tell the truth,
dear Charley. I will set you a good example.
You shall never learn to tell a lie from me."
Henry had always remembered what his Mother
had said to him, the very first time he ever saw
his little brother; and very often, when he was
tempted to be naughty, or get in a passion, the
words, "Your brother will do just as you do,"
would seem to come from his heart, and he would
conquer his passion.</p>

<p>In a few moments the boys heard the wheels
of the carriage. Henry went to the hall door,
and opened it. He held Charles by the hand.
He had to hold him very tight, for Charles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
tried to get away. His face was pale. He
waited until his Mother got out of the carriage
and came up the steps, and, taking hold of
her hand and looking up in her face, he said,
in a firm voice, "Mother, I have broken your
vase."</p>

<p>"And I, too," said the little boy; "and it is
broken all to pieces."</p>

<p>Henry was glad to hear his little brother say
this; and oh! how happy it made him feel, to
think that the child had learned to speak the
truth from him.</p>

<p>Their Mother kissed them both and said,
"My darling boys, I am rejoiced that you are
not afraid to speak the truth. I would rather
lose twenty vases than have you tell a lie. But
you knew it was wrong to play in the parlours;
did you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear Mother, it was wrong, and I
knew it was," replied Henry. "I will submit
to any punishment you think right. I ought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to have remembered that you advised us not to
go there."</p>

<p>"If you think you ought to be punished,"
said his Mother, "Charley shall go to bed to-night
without your singing to him. This will
make you both remember. Is that right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear Mother," said Henry; but he
looked very sorry; and little Charles made up a
long face, for he loved his brother so much, that
he could not bear to think that he must go to
sleep without holding his finger and hearing him
sing.</p>

<p>When bed-time came, Charley wanted to beg
his Mother to think of some other punishment for
him. He wanted his dear brother so much. He
looked at Henry, but Henry said, "Good-night,
little fellow; we deserve this. Come! one night
will soon be over. Now, let us see how well
you can behave;" and he gave him a smile, and
a kiss so full of love, that the little fellow put
his lips tight together, and marched off to bed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
without a tear. It was hard to do it, but he
had this kind brother to set him a good example,
and he was determined to be as good a boy as
Henry.</p>

<p>Not many weeks after this, poor little Charles
was taken sick. He was very sick indeed, and
every day he grew worse. The doctor did all he
could for him, and Henry stayed with him night
and day, and would hardly take any rest. He
gave him all his medicine, and sang to him very
often when he was in pain. But Charles did
not get any better, and at last the doctor said
that he could not make him well&mdash;the little boy
must die.</p>

<p>When Henry heard this, the tears burst from
his eyes, and he sobbed out, "Oh, my brother!
oh, my brother! I cannot part with you, my
little precious brother."</p>

<p>The poor little fellow had become so weak
and thin that he could scarcely lift his hands
from the bed where he lay.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
The last night came. He knew that he
would not live many hours, for his dear Mother
had said so; and now she told him, that as
he had always tried to be a good boy, he would
go to Heaven, and Jesus would take him into
His bosom, and love him, and keep him, until
they came to him.</p>

<p>His little pale face grew bright. "Dear
Mother," said he, "will Jesus let my brother
come to me? I want my brother in Heaven.
Come here close to me," said he to Henry. His
brother leaned his face down close to the little
boy's face, and helped him clasp his arms around
his neck, and then he whispered, in a soft, weak
voice, "Do not cry, dear brother&mdash;do not cry any
more. I will pray to Jesus to let you come very
soon and sing me to sleep in Heaven."</p>

<p>These were the last words he spoke, for his
breath grew shorter and shorter, and soon after
his little hand dropped away from his brother's,
and he was dead.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
And his Father had him buried in Highgate
Cemetery.</p>

<p>It was in the summer time that he died, and
his brother Henry planted a white rose-bush at
the foot of the little grave, and a red rose-bush
at the head, and often in the pleasant summer
afternoons he would go alone to Highgate, and
sit upon little Charley's grave, and think how he
might at that moment be praying for him in
Heaven.</p>

<p>Henry is now a man. He was always a good
boy. He is now a good man; and although
many years have passed since he lost his little
brother, he goes every summer to Highgate to
visit his grave; and the tears always come into
his eyes when he speaks of him, and tells that
little Charley's last words were, that he would
pray to Jesus to let his darling brother come

<h2><a name="ANNIE_BROWNE">ANNIE BROWNE.</a></h2>


<p>Little Annie Browne was an only child, that
is, she had no little brothers or sisters; so you
may be sure her parents loved this little girl very
much indeed, and were always endeavouring to
make her happy. Now I wonder if the dear
little boy or girl, who is reading this, can guess
the means that Annie's Father and Mother took
to make her happy.</p>

<p>Did they give her plenty of candy? No.
Did they buy new play-things for her every day?
No. Did they take her very often to the Museum
or the Zoological Gardens? No; this was not
the way. I will tell you what they did; and I
will tell you what Annie did for one whole day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
when she was about five years old, and that will
give you a very good idea of the way they took to
make her <em>good</em>, for then she was <em>sure</em> to be
<em>happy</em>.</p>

<p>Well, one day Annie woke up very early in
the morning, and, sitting up in her little bed,
which was close by the side of her Mamma's, she
first rubbed her eyes, and then she looked all
round the room, and saw a narrow streak of
bright light on the wall. It was made by the
sun shining through a crack in the shutter. She
began to sing softly this little song, that she had
learned in school,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What is it shines so very bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That quick dispels the dusky night?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It is the sun&mdash;the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shedding around its cheerful light,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It is the sun&mdash;the sun."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Presently she looked round again, and saw
her Mamma sleeping. She said, in her soft little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
voice, "Mamma, Mamma! good morning, dear
Mamma!"</p>

<p>But her Mamma did not wake up. Then she
crept over her to where her Papa was sleeping,
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Papa, Papa! good morning, dear Papa!"</p>

<p>But her Papa was too fast asleep to hear
her. So she gave her Papa a little kiss on the
end of his nose, and laid gently down between
them.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, her Papa woke up, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why! what little monkey is this in the
bed?" which made Annie laugh very much. She
then jumped out of bed, and put on her stockings
and shoes herself, as all little boys and girls
of five years old ought, and washed her face and
hands, and put on her clothes; and her Mamma,
who was now awake, fastened them, and brushed
her hair nicely. After that, she said some little
prayers that her Mamma had taught her, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
then ran down stairs, singing as gaily as a lark,
and dancing as lightly as a fairy.</p>

<p>After breakfast, her Mamma got her school
basket (it was a cunning little basket), and put
in it a nice slice of bread and butter, and a
peach, and gave her a little bouquet of flowers to
present to her teacher, whom little Annie loved
dearly; and then her Mamma said, "Good bye,
my darling!" and Annie made her such a funny
little curtsey, that she nearly tumbled over, and
off she went to school with her Papa, who always
saw her safe to the door.</p>

<p>Annie staid in school from nine o'clock until
two. When she came home, her Mother kissed
her, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you been a good little girl in school
to-day?"</p>

<p>"I think I have," said Annie; "Miss Harriet
said that I was very diligent. What is diligent,
Mamma?"</p>

<p>"To be diligent, my dear," answered her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Mamma, "means to study your lesson all the
time, without thinking of play, or anything else,
until you know it perfectly."</p>

<p>Annie said she was glad it meant such good
things, and added, "Mamma, will you play I am
a lady coming to see you, if you are not too
busy?"</p>

<p>Her Mamma said she would. So Annie got
her two dolls. One was a very pretty wax doll,
with eyes that could open and shut. Her name
was Emily; and the other was not wax, but was
larger. Her name was Augusta. Annie put on
their hats and shawls, and dressed herself in an
old hat, with a green veil, and came near her
Mamma, and made believe ring a bell, and said,
"Ting a ling, ting a ling."</p>

<p>"Come in," said her Mamma.</p>

<p>Little Annie shook hands with her Mamma,
and said, "How do you do, Mrs. Browne?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I am very well," said her
Mamma. "Take a seat, my dear Mrs. Frisby,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that was Annie's name. "How are your children,
Mrs. Frisby?"</p>

<p>"Oh! they are very sick," answered Annie;
"one has the toothache, and the other has a little
square hole in the back of her head, and it has
made her head ache."</p>

<p>"Dear me! Mrs. Frisby," said her Mamma,
"I am very sorry to hear it; you ought to go to
the doctor with them."</p>

<p>Then Annie pretended to go to the doctor,
and she took out of the drawer a little bit of
sugar for medicine. She ate the medicine up herself,
and said that it had done the dollies a great
deal of good. In this pleasant way she amused
herself until dinner time.</p>

<p>After dinner, her Papa and Mamma took her
to the Park, as it was a pleasant day; and there
Annie jumped about with other little girls, or ran
with her great hoop. She could roll the hoop
very well.</p>

<p>Then she came skipping home, and had her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
tea; and after that her mother undressed her and
heard her say her prayers, and kissed her for
good night; and she jumped into bed, and in a
moment was fast asleep. Don't you think Annie
was a happy little girl? <em>I</em> think she was, for all
her days passed in this pleasant manner. Some
other time, perhaps, I will tell you more about
little Annie Browne.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_THREE_BEARS">THE THREE BEARS.</a><a name="FNanchor_A_1" href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[*]</a></h2>


<p>Once upon a time there were Three Bears,
who lived together in a house of their own, in a
wood. One of them was a Little, Small, Wee
Bear; and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the
other was a Great, Huge Bear. They had each
a pot for their porridge, a little pot for the Little,
Small, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized pot for the
Middle Bear, and a great pot for the Great,
Huge Bear. And they had each a chair to sit
in; a little chair for the Little, Small, Wee
Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the Middle
Bear; and a great chair for the Great, Huge
Bear. And they had each a bed to sleep in; a
little bed for the Little, Small, Wee Bear; and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
middle-sized bed for the Middle Bear; and a
great bed for the Great, Huge Bear.</p>

<p>One day, after they had made the porridge
for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-pots,
they walked out into the wood while
the porridge was cooling, that they might not
burn their mouths, by beginning too soon to eat
it. And while they were walking, a little old
Woman came to the house. She could not have
been a good, honest old Woman; for first she
looked in at the window, and then she peeped in
at the keyhole; and seeing nobody in the house,
she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened,
because the Bears were good Bears, who did
nobody any harm, and never suspected that any
body would harm them. So the little old Woman
opened the door and went in; and well pleased
she was when she saw the porridge on the table.
If she had been a good little old Woman, she
would have waited till the Bears came home, and
then, perhaps, they would have asked her to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
breakfast; for they were good Bears,&mdash;a little
rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for
all that very good-natured and hospitable. But
she was an impudent, bad old Woman, and set
about helping herself.</p>

<p>So first she tasted the porridge of the Great,
Huge Bear, and that was too hot for her; and
she said a bad word about that. And then she
tasted the porridge of the Middle Bear, and that
was too cold for her; and she said a bad word
about that too. And then she went to the porridge
of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and tasted
that; and that was neither too hot nor too cold,
but just right; and she liked it so well, that she
ate it all up: but the naughty old Woman said a
bad word about the little porridge-pot, because it
did not hold enough for her.</p>

<p>Then the little old Woman sate down in the
chair of the Great, Huge Bear, and that was too
hard for her. And then she sate down in the
chair of the Middle Bear, and that was too soft
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
for her. And then she sate down in the chair of
the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and that was neither
too hard, nor too soft, but just right. So she
seated herself in it, and there she sate till the
bottom of the chair came out, and down came
hers, plump upon the ground. And the naughty
old Woman said a wicked word about that too.</p>

<p>Then the little old Woman went up stairs
into the bed-chamber in which the three Bears
slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of
the Great, Huge Bear; but that was too high at
the head for her. And next she lay down upon
the bed of the Middle Bear; and that was too
high at the foot for her. And then she lay down
upon the bed of the Little, Small, Wee Bear; and
that was neither too high at the head, nor at the
foot, but just right. So she covered herself up
comfortably, and lay there till she fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>By this time the Three Bears thought their
porridge would be cool enough; so they came
home to breakfast. Now the little old Woman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
had left the spoon of the Great, Huge Bear,
standing in his porridge.</p>

<p class="center great-bear">"Somebody has been at my porridge!"</p>

<p>said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough,
gruff voice. And when the Middle Bear looked
at his, he saw that the spoon was standing in it
too. They were wooden spoons; if they had been
silver ones, the naughty old Woman would have
put them in her pocket.</p>

<p class="center middle-bear">"Somebody has been at my porridge!"</p>

<p>said the Middle Bear, in his middle voice.</p>

<p>Then the Little, Small, Wee Bear looked at
his, and there was the spoon in the porridge-pot,
but the porridge was all gone.</p>

<p class="center little-bear">"Somebody has been at my porridge, and has eaten it all up!"</p>

<p>said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little,
small, wee voice.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Upon this the Three Bears, seeing that some
one had entered their house, and eaten up the
Little, Small, Wee Bear's breakfast, began to
look about them. Now the little old Woman
had not put the hard cushion straight when she
rose from the chair of the Great, Huge Bear.</p>

<p class="center great-bear">"Somebody has been sitting in
my chair!"</p>

<p>said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough,
gruff voice.</p>

<p>And the little old Woman had squatted down
the soft cushion of the Middle Bear.</p>

<p class="center middle-bear">"Somebody has been sitting in
my chair!"</p>

<p>said the Middle Bear, in his middle voice.</p>

<p>And you know what the little old Woman
had done to the third chair.</p>

<p class="center little-bear">"Somebody has been sitting in my chair, and has sate the
bottom of it out!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little,
small, wee voice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 509px;">
<img src="images/img01.png" width="509" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Then the Three Bears thought it necessary
that they should make further search; so they
went up stairs into their bed-chamber. Now the
little old Woman had pulled the pillow of the
Great, Huge Bear, out of its place.</p>

<p class="center great-bear">"Somebody has been lying in
my bed!"</p>

<p>said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough,
gruff voice.</p>

<p>And the little old Woman had pulled the
bolster of the Middle Bear out of its place.</p>

<p class="center middle-bear">"Somebody has been lying in my
bed!"</p>

<p>said the Middle Bear, in his middle voice.</p>

<p>And when the Little, Small, Wee Bear came
to look at his bed, there was the bolster in its
place; and the pillow in its place upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
bolster; and upon the pillow was the little old
Woman's ugly, dirty head,&mdash;which was not in its
place, for she had no business there.</p>

<p class="center little-bear">"Somebody has been lying in my bed,&mdash;and here she is!"</p>

<p>said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little,
small, wee voice.</p>

<p>The little old Woman had heard in her sleep
the great, rough, gruff voice of the Great, Huge
Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no
more to her than the roaring of wind, or the
rumbling of thunder. And she had heard the
middle voice of the Middle Bear, but it was only
as if she had heard some one speaking in a
dream. But when she heard the little, small,
wee voice of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, it was
so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at
once. Up she started; and when she saw the
Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled
herself out at the other, and ran to the window.
Now the window was open, because the Bears,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always
opened their bed-chamber window when they got
up in the morning. Out the little old Woman
jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the
fall; or ran into the wood and was lost there; or
found her way out of the wood, and was taken up
by the constable and sent to the House of Correction
for a vagrant as she was, I cannot tell.
But the Three Bears never saw anything more of
her.</p>

<h2><a name="ABOUT_MINDING_QUICKLY">ABOUT MINDING QUICKLY.</a></h2>


<p>Emma was one day sitting by the fire, on a
little stool. She was trying to cut a mouse out of
a piece of paper. She had a pair of scissors, with
round ends. Her mother had given her these
scissors for her own, because they were safer for
her to use than scissors with pointed ends.</p>

<p>Presently, her Mother said, "Come here to
me, Emma."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Mother," said Emma.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said her Mother, "that it
was naughty for you to say that?"</p>

<p>"Why, you can wait a <em>little</em> minute," said
Emma; "I am very busy. Don't you see that
I am making a mouse?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
"Emma," replied her Mother, "do you know
that I ought to punish you, because you do not
mind?"</p>

<p>"I am coming directly," cried Emma, dropping
her scissors and her paper mouse, and running
up to her Mother.</p>

<p>Her Mother took her up on her lap, and said,
"My little girl, this will <em>never</em> do. You must
learn to come at once when you are called; you
<em>must</em> obey quickly. If you continue in this very
naughty habit of not minding until you are told
to do a thing two or three times, you will grow
up a very disagreeable girl, and nobody will love
you."</p>

<p>Emma looked up mournfully into her Mother's
face, and said, "Mother, I will try to do
better."</p>

<p>She was a good-tempered child, and was seldom
cross or sullen; but she had this one bad
habit, and it was a very bad habit indeed&mdash;she
waited to be told twice, and sometimes oftener,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and many times she made her kind Mother very
unhappy.</p>

<p>For a few days after this Emma remembered
what her Mother had said to her, and always
came the first time she was called. She came
pleasantly, for it is very important to mind pleasantly,
and did everything she was told to do immediately;
and her Mother loved her dearly, and
hoped she was quite cured of her naughty ways.</p>

<p>But I am very sorry to have to say that a time
came when Emma entirely forgot her promise.
You shall hear how it happened.</p>

<p>One morning Emma's Mother said to her,
"Emma, it is time for you to get up, and put on
your stockings and shoes."</p>

<p>Emma did not move. She lay with her eyes
wide open, watching a fly on the wall, that was
scrubbing his thin wings with his hind legs.</p>

<p>"Did you hear me, Emma? Put on your
stockings and shoes!"</p>

<p>Emma got up very slowly. She put one foot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
out of bed, and then looked again at the fly.
This time he was scrubbing his face with his fore
legs. So she sat there, and said to herself, "I
wonder how that funny little fly can stay upon
the wall. I can't walk up the wall as the fly can.
What a little round black head he has got!"</p>

<p>"Emma!" said her Mother, and this time
she spoke in a very severe tone.</p>

<p>Emma started, and put her other foot out of
bed, and took up one of her stockings.</p>

<p>Her Mother got out of her bed, which was
close to Emma's crib, and began to dress herself.
When she was dressed, she looked round, and
saw Emma, with one stocking half on, and the
other rolled up in a little ball, which she was
throwing up in the air.</p>

<p>Her Mother was angry with her. She went
up to her, and took her stocking away from her,
and told her to get into bed again; for if she
would not dress herself when her Mother bid her,
she should be punished by being made to lie in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
bed. She shut up the window shutters, and took
all the books out of the room, and telling Emma
not to get up until she gave her leave, she went
down stairs to breakfast.</p>

<p>Now children don't like to be in bed in the
daytime,&mdash;at least I have never heard of any one
that did; and Emma was soon tired of lying in a
dark room wide awake, with nothing to do, and
no pleasant thoughts, for she could think of nothing but
her naughty behaviour. So this was a
very severe punishment, and she began to cry,
and wish she had minded quickly, and then she
would have been down stairs, where the sun was
shining brightly into the windows. She would
have been sitting in her chair, with her dear little
kitten in her lap, and a nice bowl of bread and
milk for her breakfast. She always saved a little
milk in the bottom of the bowl for Daisy her kitten,
and after she had done, she would give the
rest to Daisy. So you see that Emma lost much
pleasure by not minding quickly; and, what was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
worse than all, she had displeased her Mother,
and made her unhappy.</p>

<p>Oh, how weary she got! how she longed to
get up! She did not dare to disobey her Mother,
and she lay in her crib a long, long time, and
thought she never could be so naughty again.</p>

<p>At last her Mother came into the room. She
opened the shutters, and said, "Emma, you may
get up and put on your stockings and shoes."</p>

<p>Emma jumped up quickly, and had them on
in two minutes, and then she took off her night-gown
and put on her day-clothes, which hung
over the back of the chair by her crib, and went
to her Mother to have them fastened, for she
could not fasten them herself. Her Mother fastened
her clothes, and then, taking her little girl's
hand, she said, "My dear little Emma, you have
made me feel very unhappy this morning. I do
not like to punish you, but it is my duty to try to
cure you of all your naughty ways, and it is your
duty to try to overcome them. If you do not,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
some day you may meet with some terrible misfortune,
like that which happened to a boy I used to
know when I was young. I will tell you the story.
This boy, like you, grieved his parents often, by
not minding quickly; and he suffered for it in a
way that he will never forget as long as he lives.
He was one day standing on the steps of the
house where he lived, and I was standing at the
window of the house opposite, where I lived. I
was watching some men that were on the top of
this boy's house, fixing the slates on the roof.
The roof was covered with loose pieces of slate,
and nails, and rubbish.</p>

<p>"Presently one of the men on the roof cried
out, 'Go in, little boy; go in.' But the boy was
looking at a kite that some other boys had in the
street, and he did not choose to go in. The man
thought that he had minded what he told him,
and without looking again he tumbled down a
great heap of slates and rubbish. The house was
quite high, and a large and sharp piece of slate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
came down very swiftly, and struck the boy on
the side of his head, and cut off nearly the whole
of his ear. In a moment the blood poured down
his neck and over his clothes, and I thought he
would bleed to death. Oh, Emma! what a
dreadful punishment for not minding quickly!</p>

<p>"For a long time he went about with his
head bound up, and when he got well again the
side of his face looked very bad indeed, for where
his ear had been there was a dreadful scar that
never went away. Now he is a man, and he
often tells children how he got this dreadful scar,
and all because he did not mind quickly."</p>

<p>The tears had rolled down Emma's face while
her Mother was telling her this story. When she
had finished it, Emma put her arms around her
Mother's neck, and told her that indeed she would
try to obey at once, and be a good little girl, so
that her dear Mother would never be unhappy
about her again.</p>

<p>Her Mother kissed her, and took her down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
stairs, and gave her some breakfast, and all this
day, and ever after, she did try very hard to be
good. Whenever she felt herself going about
anything slowly, the thought of the poor boy
who had lost his ear would come into her mind,
and she would jump up at once, when her Mother
called her, and do whatever she wanted her to
do, pleasantly and quickly.</p>



<div class="new-h2"></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="THE_TWINS">THE TWINS.</a></h2>


<p>"Well, Susan," said her Father one day,
as she came home from school, "I am glad to
see you; I wish to inform you that two young
gentlemen arrived here to-day."</p>

<p>"What are their names, Father?" asked
Susan.</p>

<p>"I do not know," answered her Father; "I
do not believe they have got any names. They
are very small&mdash;so small that at this moment
they are both asleep in the great chair."</p>

<p>"Both asleep in the great chair?" cried
Susan, astonished at what her Father had said,
"I do believe you have been buying two little
monkeys."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
"No, I have not," said her Father, laughing.
"Now come with me, and I will show you these
strangers, and then see if you will say they are
monkeys."</p>

<p>Susan went with her Father. He took her
hand, and led her into her Mother's room. The
room was dark, and her Mother was lying in the
bed. Susan was afraid that she was sick. She
went to her and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear Mother, are you sick? You look
very pale."</p>

<p>Her Mother kissed her, and said, "I am very
weak, my dear child; but do you not want to
see your little brothers?"</p>

<p>"Brothers?&mdash;where?" cried Susan. "Have
I a brother?"</p>

<p>"Two of them," said her Father. "Come
here, Susan, here they both are, fast asleep."</p>

<p>Susan went up to the great easy chair, and
on the cushion she saw, all tucked up warm, two
little round fat faces lying close together. Their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
noses nearly touched each other, and they looked
funny enough.</p>

<p>"Well, Susan," said her Father, "do you
like the monkeys?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Father!" answered the little girl, clasping
her hands, "I am so glad&mdash;I am so happy!
They are exactly alike,&mdash;how I shall love them,
the dear little toads!"</p>

<p>"Toads!" said her Father, laughing; "they
don't look a bit like toads."</p>

<p>"Well, I said that because I loved them so,"
replied Susan, "just as you sometimes call me
your little mouse."</p>

<p>For two weeks the little twins slept together
in the great chair, and there was no end to Susan's
wonder and delight. Her Mother had to
tie a bit of red silk around the wrist of one of
them, to tell them apart. They grew very fast,
and were the dearest little fellows in the world,
they had such bright, merry, black eyes, and
were always ready to have a frolic with Susan.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
As they grew up, they were so good and so
pretty, that everybody loved them, and a great
many people came to see them. I forgot to tell
you that one was named George, and the other
James.</p>

<p>One day, when the twins were three years
old, they were left alone in the breakfast-room.
The things on the breakfast-table had been cleared
away, except a bowl nearly full of sugar, which
was standing on the table.</p>

<p>Presently the little fellows spied the bowl
of sugar. "George," said James, "if you will
help me with this chair, I will give you some
sugar."</p>

<p>So both the boys took hold of the heavy chair,
and dragged it to the table. Then James helped
George to climb upon it, and from that he scrambled
up on the table. He walked across, to
where the sugar was, and sat down on the table,
and took the sugar-bowl in his lap.</p>

<p>"Now, you get the stool," said George.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
So James got the stool, and put it close to
the side of the table where George was, and stood
upon it.</p>

<p>You should have seen how their merry black
eyes sparkled, at the fine feast they were going
to have. They did not think that they were
doing wrong, for their Mother had often given
them a little sugar.</p>

<p>So George took the spoon that was in the
sugar, and helped James to a spoonful, and then
took one himself. He was very particular to
give James exactly as many spoonfuls as he took
himself.</p>

<p>They were having such a delightful time, that
for some moments they did not speak a single
word. George began first,&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is nice," said George.</p>

<p>"I like sugar," said James.</p>

<p>"It is so sweet," said George.</p>

<p>"And so good," said James.</p>

<p>"We will eat it all up," said George.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
"We won't leave a bit," said James.</p>

<p>"It is almost all gone," said George.</p>

<p>"There is hardly any left," said James.</p>

<p>All the time they were talking George had
been stuffing his brother and himself with the
sugar.</p>

<p>Just then their Mother opened the door. She
had opened it softly, and the little boys had not
heard her. When she saw them so busy&mdash;with
their round faces stuck all over with crumbs of
sugar, and George sitting on the table, dealing it
out so fairly&mdash;she could not keep from laughing.</p>

<p>The twins heard her laugh, so they laughed
too; and George cried out, "Mother, this sugar
is nice&mdash;I like it."</p>

<p>"And so do I," said James.</p>

<p>Their Mother lifted George from the table,
and told them they must not do so again, for so
much sugar would make them sick. She washed
their faces, and sent them to play in the garden.
There was a fine large garden at the back of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the house, where they could play without
danger.</p>

<p>Three years after this, the twins were sent
to school, where they soon became great favourites,
because they were amiable and good, and
always willing to do as they were told. They
looked so exactly alike, and were dressed so exactly
alike, that often very funny mistakes were
made. I will tell you something that happened,
that was not funny, but it will show you how hard
it was to tell which was George, and which was
James.</p>

<p>One day, the teacher gave the twins a spelling
lesson, and told them that they must know
it perfectly that morning.</p>

<p>Now George, for the first time, was naughty,
and instead of learning the lesson, he was making
elephants and giraffes on his slate; but
James studied his lesson, and soon knew it.
Presently the teacher said, "James, do you know
your lesson?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
"Yes, sir," said James. He went up to the
desk and said it very well.</p>

<p>"You know it perfectly," said his teacher;
"you are a good boy. Now go to your seat."</p>

<p>In a few moments he said, "George, come
and say your lesson."</p>

<p>But George did not know a word of it; and
James whispered to him, "I don't want you to
be punished, brother; I will go for you and say it
again."</p>

<p>So James went and repeated his lesson. The
teacher thought of course it was George; he
said, "Very well, indeed, George; you know
it just as well as James: you are <em>both</em> good
boys."</p>

<p>When George heard this praise, which he
did not deserve, he was troubled. He had been
taught never to deceive. He did not think at
first how wrong he had been; <em>now</em>, he saw
plainly, that it was very wrong; that he and his
brother had been <em>acting</em> a lie.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
He whispered to James, "Brother, I can't
bear to cheat, so I will go and tell the teacher."</p>

<p>So he went directly up to the desk, and said,
"Sir, I have not yet said my lesson."</p>

<p>"Why, yes you have," replied the teacher;
"I have just heard you say it."</p>

<p>"No, sir, if you please," said George; "I do
not know it at all. James said it twice, to save
me from being punished."</p>

<p>"Well, George," replied his teacher, "I am
very glad you have told me this. I never should
have found it out. But your conscience told you
that you were doing wrong; and I am thankful
you have listened to its warnings, and made up
your mind at once to be an honest boy. I will
not punish you or James, for I am sure neither
of you will do so again."</p>

<p>The little boys promised him they never
would&mdash;and they never did; and they grew up
to be honest and good men.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LITTLE_BOY_THAT_WAS_AFRAID_OF_THE_WATER">THE
LITTLE BOY THAT WAS AFRAID OF
THE WATER.</a></h2>


<p>Once on a time there were two little boys.
William was five years old, and Johnny was not
quite three. The weather was very warm, and
these little boys got so weak, and looked so pale
and sick, that the doctor said their parents had
better take them to Hastings, and let them bathe
in the sea. So their Mother packed up their
clothes, and some books, for she did not wish
them to be idle; and one pleasant afternoon they
all went by the railway to Hastings.</p>

<p>The little boys were very much amused at all
they saw. There were several other boys in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
carriage, and William and Johnny looked very
hard at them, and wished they knew what their
names were, and whether they had a Noah's
Ark and Rocking-Horse like theirs.</p>

<p>After three hours' ride by the puffing,
screaming railway, they arrived safely at Hastings,
and they found a carriage waiting for them,
which soon took them to the house which their
papa had hired. Tea was immediately brought
up, and then, as they were all very tired, they
went early to bed.</p>

<p>After breakfast the next morning, William
and Johnny walked down to the smooth and
beautiful beach with their parents, where a
great many people, some of them children, were
bathing. They seemed to like it very much;
and it really did look very inviting, for the sun
made the water sparkle like diamonds, and the
waves seemed dancing and leaping, and looked
as if they longed to give everybody a good
splashing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
William was delighted. He could hardly
wait to be undressed, he was in such a great
hurry to be ducked; and when the bathing-woman
took him and plunged him under the
water, although he gasped for breath, he laughed,
and kicked, and splashed the water, and cried,
"Duck me again! duck me again!" and he
looked so pleased, that some other children came
to where he was, and they all had a grand frolic
together.</p>

<p>Little Johnny laughed too, as he stood in the
machine; but, when his Mother said, "Come,
Johnny, now it is your turn," he made a terrible
face, and cried, "Dear Mamma, please let me go
home. I shall never see you again if you put me
in that great big water." But his Mamma said
he must go in, because it would do him a great
deal of good, and she undressed him, and put
him into the woman's arms.</p>

<p>Johnny now began to scream as loud as he
could, and cried out, "Mamma, Mamma, I want
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to go back to you." But the old woman did not
mind him a bit, and holding him by his arms,
she plunged him under the water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 462px;">
<img src="images/img02.png" width="462" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The poor little fellow came up gasping and
panting, and sobbed out, "Oh, my dear Mamma,
come and kiss me 'fore I die."</p>

<p>Everybody laughed&mdash;for there was no danger&mdash;except
his kind Mother. A tear started to
her eye, for she knew her dear little son really
thought he was dying, and would never see her
again. But in a little while he felt better, and,
after his Mother had taken him, and had rubbed
him all over and dressed him, and he had run up
and down the beach with William and the other
children, he felt such a nice warm glow all over
him, that he forgot all about his fright.</p>

<p>Very soon he said, "Mamma, I am so hungry&mdash;I
am as hungry as a little bear."</p>

<p>"That is because you have been in the
water," replied his Mother.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
"Are the fishes always hungry?&mdash;does the
water make them hungry too?" said Johnny.</p>

<p>"I believe they are always ready to eat,"
replied his Mother; "you know that they are
caught by bait. This bait is often a little worm,
put upon a sharp hook. The fish snap at the
bait, and the hook catches them in the mouth.
Come, little hungry fish," added his Mother,
"and I will give you something to eat; but I
will not put it on a hook to hurt you."</p>

<p>The next day the little boys went into the
water again, and, although Johnny made up a
doleful face, he did not think he should die this
time; and, when he saw the other children
laughing and splashing each other, and crying,
"Duck me again! what fun we are having!" he
tried to like it too, and after a little while did
begin to like it; for when children <em>try</em> to overcome
their foolish fears, they will almost always
succeed, and be rewarded, as Johnny was, by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
pleasure they enjoy, and the happiness they give
to their parents.</p>

<p>After a few days Johnny got to be so brave,
that he was the first to run down to the beach
and jump into the bathing-woman's arms, and he
cried louder than any, "Duck me again!" and
splashed everybody that came near him; and
both William and Johnny got so strong, and ate
so heartily, and had such great red cheeks, that
when they went home to London, a few weeks
after, their friends hardly knew them, and Johnny
never again had any foolish fears about going into
the water.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="THE_MAY_QUEEN">THE MAY QUEEN.</a></h2>


<p>"Mother," said Frederick Stanley, "is it
not wrong to treat servants unkindly?"</p>

<p>"What makes you ask that question?" answered
his Mother. "What can have put that
into your head?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;I don't know," replied he, looking
at his sister Kate, who was sitting near him,
working a pair of slippers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stanley saw that there was something
on their mind, so she laid down her book, and
tried to draw it out. She began,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is the reason that your little Scottish
friend Jessie has not been here lately? I thought
that you, Kate, could not take a walk with any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
pleasure without her, and Fred has become quite
a beau since her arrival. I am afraid you have
done or said something to offend her."</p>

<p>"Fred," said Kate,&mdash;who was two years
younger than her brother, and much smaller,
and had a great respect for him,&mdash;"Fred, do
you tell Mother."</p>

<p>Fred gave his trousers a little pull, shook the
hair away from his face, half laughed, and did
not speak a word; but Kate, like a real little
woman, could not keep the secret a moment
longer.</p>

<p>"We have had a quarrel, Mother; that's
all."</p>

<p>"'A quarrel! that's all!'" said her Mother.
"That's a great deal too much; but what did
you find to quarrel about?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mother," answered Fred, getting
over his bashfulness, now that the secret was
out, "it was all about treating servants with
kindness."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
"Well done!" exclaimed his Mother. "Let
us hear what you had to say upon the subject."</p>

<p>"I said it was a shame to abuse those who
were poorer than we were; that in God's eyes all
were equal. I could not bear to hear Jessie say
that she had her own servant at home, and when
this servant did anything to displease her, she
would pinch and slap her. I told her she was a
downright wicked girl!"</p>

<p>"Oh, shocking! shocking!" said Mrs. Stanley.
"And, my sweet little Kate, did you too
stand up for kindness to servants?"</p>

<p>"I did all I could, dear Mother," she replied,
"but Fred did the most."</p>

<p>"Well, tell me, what else did you say?"</p>

<p>"I told her," said Fred, hesitating a little,
"that here we said, 'if you please,' and 'thank
you,' when a servant did anything for us, and
that she had better go back to Scotland, and not
stay another day in a place where she was deprived
of the pleasure of pinching people."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
"Oh, Frederick! Frederick! how could a
boy of your politeness be so rude to a young
lady? That was a great mistake."</p>

<p>Frederick looked mortified, and Kate hung
her head. "But what happened after that?"
asked Mrs. Stanley.</p>

<p>"Oh, she was so angry that she went away,
and we have not seen her since. I am very
sorry; but it can't be helped now."</p>

<p>"No," said Kate, "we can't help it now."</p>

<p>"But, my dear children," said their Mother,
"I think you owe Jessie an apology."</p>

<p>"I have no objection," said Fred, after reflecting
a moment, "if you think I have been so
very impolite; but it will do no good."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Stanley, "it must be done.
Perhaps I can assist you in making up the quarrel.
Next Thursday, you know, is the first of
May. You shall have a little party, and Jessie
shall be Queen of May. That will be certain to
please her."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
"Jessie! Queen!" exclaimed Kate. "She
will not, Mother. Jessie will not come; I am
sure she will not come. I do not believe she
will ever speak to us again."</p>

<p>"I tell you she <em>will</em> come," said her Mother;
"and she will be Queen. I will manage it for
you."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, Mother," said Fred, looking at
his sister, "you don't know Jessie as well as we
do. She won't forgive us so easily."</p>

<p>Company now came in, and the children went
to their studies. In the afternoon Mrs. Stanley
sent a polite invitation to Jessie and her parents
to pass the next Thursday evening at her house;
and as they were sitting at the tea-table, the
answer was returned.</p>

<p>"There," said Mrs. Stanley, "one point is
gained; they will all come."</p>

<p>"They may come," said Frederick, "but she
won't be civil to us, I know."</p>

<p>The next day was spent in preparing the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
crown, throne, and flowers, &amp;c., and Frederick
set himself to work to learn by heart some lines
his Mother had written for the occasion.</p>

<p>Thursday evening arrived, and the children,
though afraid of Jessie's cold looks, were in
good spirits. Kate came into the parlour, and
found Fred before a large glass, making his
speech, and practising the most graceful bows
and gestures.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" she exclaimed, "how light and
beautiful the room looks! Oh, Fred, I hope we
shall have a pleasant time."</p>

<p>The arrival of the company now interrupted
them, and when nearly all had come, Mrs. Stanley
told her plan with regard to Jessie; and this
important matter was just settled, when that
young lady and her parents entered.</p>

<p>Jessie, not knowing the honour awaiting her,
was very stiff and grave in her salutations. Her
large dark eyes were turned away from Fred and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Kate, yet an expression about her pretty mouth
seemed to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am not so very angry as you think."</p>

<p>"She <em>looks</em> like a Queen, does not she?" whispered
Fred to his sister.</p>

<p>"She is stiff enough, at any rate," said
Kate.</p>

<p>"I wonder whom she will choose for her
King?" said Fred.</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know," answered Kate,
looking round. "I suppose the biggest boy."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Fred, "I forget that
I must go out until it is time for the Address;"
and he left the room, to wait his Mother's
signal.</p>

<p>Refreshments were now handed round the
room, and many a sly glance was cast upon the
unconscious Jessie, who was still looking very
grave, and almost cross, till, at a hint from his
Mother, Fred made his appearance, and with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
blushing face, but firm voice, pronounced the
following lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O valiant knights, and ladies fair!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I'm very glad to see you here;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Your happy looks and eyes so bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Have quite inspired me to-night.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Though I'm unused to courtly ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My choice from you will meet with praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Our English land, so brave and free,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where waves the flag of liberty,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Can yet, while all our hearts approve,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Scottish stranger fondly love.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">(No looks of grave distrust are seen,)<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fair Jessie! I proclaim you Queen!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And kneeling lowly at your feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To be your knight I do entreat.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now deign to say, what happy one<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Amongst us all shall share your throne?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Fred rose from his knees, and awaited Jessie's
reply.</p>

<p>Her anger was all gone, but she was so surprised
that she looked down, and did not say a
word.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
"Well," thought Fred, "I knew she would
act so. I suppose everybody is laughing at me."</p>

<p>"Jessie," said her Mother, "speak quickly.
Whom will you have for King?"</p>

<p>Jessie blushed, and smiled, and whispered in
a soft little voice, "Frederick."</p>

<p>Astonished and delighted by this kindness,
Fred again knelt down, then rising, he took
her little white hand, and led her in triumph,
followed by all the company, to the next room,
where a splendid throne had been erected. A
beautiful crown of flowers was placed on Jessie's
head, and gave new beauty to her soft and curling
brown hair. Frederick also had a handsome
crown. Sceptres were placed in their hands, and
then they arranged their court. Kate was made
a Duchess, at which she grew quite dignified;
there were plenty of Earls and Countesses, and
the sweet little maids of honour and the pages
stood behind the throne.</p>

<p>They then formed a procession, to return to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the parlour, and in an instant a march burst forth
from a band of music which had been concealed
for the purpose.</p>

<p>At this unexpected event, his Majesty jumped
so high that his crown tumbled off, and the
Queen was in such a delightful agitation that
she could not confine her steps to a walk, and so
the King and the Queen, and the Duchess, and
all the maids of honour and pages, ran helter-skelter,
as fast as they could, and took places for
dancing.</p>

<p>Never were merrier hearts or brighter eyes
than now leaped and shone in that little party.
The Queen was the gayest of all, and the King
was nearly out of his wits with joy, to find himself
and Jessie once more friends. Little Kate
got so tired of being a Duchess that she skipped
about like a little fairy; and all the lords and
ladies, and maids of honour and pages, were so
merry and so full of innocent fun, that they
looked a great deal more like little children.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
And so the happy evening concluded, to the
satisfaction of all.</p>

<p>The next morning, Mrs. Stanley asked her
children if they had had a pleasant party.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" they both answered; "it was
perfectly delightful; and Jessie was as pleasant
as she could be, and seemed to have forgotten all
about the quarrel."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="THE_TOOTHACHE">THE TOOTHACHE.</a></h2>


<p>One day little Emily's Grandma said to her,
"My dear child, you must go with me to-day
to the dentist's, and have some of those teeth
pulled out. They are growing so fast and so
crooked, that you have not room enough in your
mouth for them all."</p>

<p>"Dear Grandma," said the little girl, "will
it hurt me <em>very</em> much?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear," replied her Grandma; "it
will hurt you a great deal, but you must try to
bear the pain; it will not be long."</p>

<p>Poor little Emily sighed, and the tears stood
in her eyes. She knew that her Grandmother
always told her the exact truth. She knew that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
she would suffer a great deal of pain, because her
Grandma had told her so.</p>

<p>It is always the best way to tell a little boy
or girl the exact truth. If Emily's Grandma
had said that it would not hurt her to have her
teeth pulled out, it would have been very wrong,
and Emily would not have believed her another
time, when she was to have anything done to
her.</p>

<p>This little girl had no Mother. Her Mother
was dead, and her Grandma took care of her,
and was very kind to her, and Emily loved her
dearly, and so she made up her mind to go and
have her teeth out, without any trouble, because
her Grandma was in bad health; and she knew
that if she cried and made a great fuss about it,
it would trouble her, and perhaps make her ill.</p>

<p>Now was not this thoughtful and good in a
little girl only seven years old? I hope all the
little boys and girls that read this will try to be
as good.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
After dinner, Emily and her Grandma put on
their bonnets, and went to the dentist's house.
The little girl trembled when the door was
opened, but she walked in without saying a
word.</p>

<p>They went into the parlour, for there were
some persons up stairs in the dentist's room, and
they had to wait.</p>

<p>"Grandma," said Emily, "may I look at
the books on the table? It will keep me from
thinking about my teeth."</p>

<p>Her Grandma said she might, and the little
girl was soon quite interested in looking at the
pictures in the books, and showing them to her
Grandma.</p>

<p>In a little while the servant came to tell her
she could go up stairs. Her heart beat fast, but
she went up to her Grandmother, and said,
"Dear Grandma, you are not well; you look
quite pale to-day. Do not go with me; I will
go alone, and I promise you I will be a brave
little girl."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
She kissed her Grandma, and ran out of the
room.</p>

<p>When she entered the room up stairs, she
saw two ladies there. She stopped; but the
dentist said, "Come in, my little girl, do not be
afraid, I will be as gentle as I can."</p>

<p>The ladies saw that she was alone, so one of
them went up to her and took her hand. She
was an old lady, and wore spectacles, and she
looked very kind and good. So the dear little
girl let the dentist lift her into the great chair,
and take off her hat, and the old lady kept hold
of her hand, and said, "It will be over in a
minute, my dear child," and then she pressed
her little hand so kindly, that Emily felt quite
comforted.</p>

<p>The other lady was a young lady, and she
too felt sorry that Emily was to suffer. She
wanted to smooth her hair, and give her a kiss;
but she thought that the little girl might be
afraid of so many strangers, so she sat down very
quietly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
When the dentist had looked into Emily's
mouth, he saw that four teeth must come out.
So he got the instrument, and held her head
tight with his arm.</p>

<p>Emily turned pale, but she kept quite still,
and did not cry or scream; and the dentist
pulled out the four teeth, one after the other,
without a sound from her lips.</p>

<p>When they were all out, some large tears
came from her eyes and rolled down her cheeks;
but she only said, "Thank you," to the lady that
held her hand; and, putting her handkerchief
to her mouth, she ran down stairs.</p>

<p>"My darling child," said her Grandma,
"how well you have behaved; I did not hear
the least noise."</p>

<p>"No, Grandma," replied Emily, "I tried
very hard not to scream; I was determined to
be quite still; and a good old lady like you,
Grandma, held my hand, which was a great comfort.
But oh! Grandma, it <em>did</em> hurt me most
terribly."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
"My dear child, I know it did," said her
Grandma; "you are the best little girl in the
world, and a happiness and a treasure to me."</p>

<p>After Emily had gone, the ladies who had
witnessed her good conduct, and admired her
courage, asked her name and where she lived;
and one of them, the young lady, sent her a
pretty little gold ring with a blue stone in it,
and a little note containing these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"For the dear little girl who had the courage
to bear a great pain nobly."</p>

<p>Emily was very much pleased with this little
present; it was so unexpected. She could not
find out who had sent it to her.</p>

<p>I hope all the little boys and girls will read
this story with attention, and when they go to
the dentist's they will think of Emily, and try
to imitate her good conduct.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="THE_BOYS_SCHOOL">THE BOYS' SCHOOL.</a></h2>


<p>Not very long ago, Mr. Harrison kept a
boarding-school for little boys in a delightful
village in Hertfordshire. He took twenty boys
to educate, and he was so kind, and had such a
pleasant way of teaching, that the boys were
happier with him than they would have been at
home.</p>

<p>When the boys came in the spring, Mr. Harrison
gave to each of them a little plot of ground
for a garden; and the little fellows were very
busy during play-hours, in preparing and arranging
their gardens. They had permission to go
to the gardener and get just what seeds they
wanted; so some of the boys planted melons and
cucumbers, and some pumpkins and radishes, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
two of them made an elegant flower-garden.
They put their ground together, and erected a
little hill in the centre, with a path all round it,
and all the borders they planted with roses, and
cockscombs, and mignonette, and sweet-peas, and
many other pretty flowers; and when the flowers
came out, their garden gave quite a brilliant
appearance to the place.</p>

<p>The boys had also a very large play-ground,
and in it their kind teacher had had a number of
gymnastic poles put up, for their healthy exercise
and amusement. There was one very high pole,
with four strong ropes fastened to the top of it,
and an iron ring at the ends of the ropes. The
boys would take hold of the rings, and run round
as fast as they could; then lifting their feet off
the ground, away they would fly in the air, round
and round, like so many little crazy monkeys.
There was one little chap that could climb up
one of the ropes like a cat, and hang upon the
top of the pole.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Then they had swinging-bars, and jumping-bars,
with a spring-board to jump from, and
wooden horses, and a climbing-pole, and several
other things; but, what was better than all, they
had a funny little ragged pony, and a short-legged,
long-eared donkey, for their especial use,
and many were the fine rides they had on their
backs.</p>

<p>Sometimes, to be sure, the pony had a fashion
of dancing a slow jig on his hind-legs, with his
fore-feet in the air; but the boys were used to
that, and stuck on until the dance was finished;
then the pony would trot off very peaceably.</p>

<p>The donkey, too, had a way of putting his
nose to the ground, and pitching his rider, head
over heels, on the grass. But the boys were used
to that too, and did not mind it in the least.
They would jump up and shake themselves, and
try again, and by dint of poking and punching
the sides of the sulky little animal, he would
after a while make up his mind to go. When
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
he had once done <em>that</em>, it was all right. You
would think he was the most amiable donkey
in the world. The pony's name was "Napoleon,"
and the boys called the donkey "Old Pudding-head."</p>

<p>Twice a-week during the summer, Mr. Harrison
took the boys to bathe in a fine pond, where
such as could would swim, and the rest would
tumble about in the water; and altogether he
was so kind to them that the boys thought there
never was a better teacher, or such a famous
boarding-school.</p>

<p>I have not yet told you that they learned anything.
I suppose you all think that playing was
the principal thing they went to that school for.
But if you do, you make a great mistake, for the
greater part of every day was spent in the school-room.</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison made school-time very pleasant.
He seldom had to punish a boy for bad conduct
or neglect in getting his lessons. He always
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
encouraged them to ask questions about their
studies, and told them never to learn anything
by rote, like a parrot, but to come to him when
they did not understand a lesson; and he always
made it so clear that it was a pleasure to learn.
Sometimes a boy would ask a foolish question,
which would make the rest laugh; but then
Mr. Harrison would say it was better to be
laughed at for trying to learn, than to grow up a
dunce.</p>

<p>In this way the boys would improve so much,
both in mind and body, that their parents left
them with Mr. Harrison as long as he could keep
them; and both the boys and their parents were
very sorry when the time came for them to leave,
for Mr. Harrison would not take any boy after
he was fourteen years of age.</p>

<p>One afternoon after school, the boys were all
busy weeding in their gardens, when one of them
suddenly cried out, "Phil, do you know how
long it is to the Fifth of November?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
"To be sure I do," answered Philip; "it is
just four weeks and four days."</p>

<p>"So it is, I declare," said Thomas, the first
boy who had spoken. "Boys, I'll tell you what
we will do. Let us all write to our parents for
an immense lot of fireworks; then we will club
together, and keep all, except the crackers, for a
grand display of fireworks in the evening."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, yes," cried all the boys, "that is an
excellent idea."</p>

<p>"I will ask Mr. Harrison," said Phil, "to
help us fix the wheels and so forth, for all I ever
fixed myself stuck fast, and would not go round
at all."</p>

<p>"I mean to write for some Roman candles,"
said Frank; "they look so beautiful going up.
They look like planets with wings."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> will ask for some snakes and grasshoppers,"
said another; "it is such fun to see
the boys racing round to get out of the way
of them."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
"We'll make some wooden pistols to put the
crackers in," said another boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I will send for a little brass cannon
that my uncle, Major Brown, gave me," said
another.</p>

<p>Just then the bell rang for tea, and the boys,
putting their little rakes and hoes into their tool-house,
ran in to wash their faces and hands, and
brush their hair. Then they took off their
blouses, which they wore when at work in the
garden, and hung them up in the play-room.
They had a nice large play-room for playing in
when the weather was unpleasant.</p>

<p>It was astonishing what large quantities of
bread and butter, and apple-sauce, these boys
consumed for their supper, for working out-of-doors
in the fresh country air is sure to make
people hungry, and boys especially are always
ready for eating. After supper, Mr. Harrison
read prayers, while all the boys knelt at their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
chairs around the table. Then they were permitted
to play out-of-doors again until the sunset.
Phil and Frank allowed themselves to be harnessed
to a hand-wagon, and galloped off at full
speed, with two of the smaller boys in it. The
rest had a game at leap-frog; and Mr. Harrison
and his family sat in the porch watching and
admiring the gorgeous tints lent to the clouds by
the rays of the setting sun, and sometimes laughing
heartily at the capers of the boys.</p>

<p>At length the sun sank beneath the horizon,
and Mr. Harrison said, "Come in, boys." He
never had to speak more than once, for the boys
were so well governed that they found it to their
advantage and happiness to obey directly. So
they came in as quietly as they could, and went
into the study, where Mr. Harrison soon joined
them, and read aloud an interesting book of
travels for an hour. Then they went up stairs
to bed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
One evening, not long after this, the boys
were all together in the sitting-room. Philip was
reading a book in which was an anecdote about a
bad boy who had frightened another, by coming
into his room at night, with his face apparently
in a blaze, and looking, as the terrified child
thought, like a flaming dragon. All at once,
Phil shut the book, and said, "I say, boys, I
will show you a funny thing, if you will put out
the light, and it will be useful to you too. But
first, let me read this story to you, and then we
will try the game, and none of you little chaps
will be frightened, because you will know what
it is."</p>

<p>So saying, he read the story, which interested
the boys very much indeed, and made them all
eager for Philip's experiment.</p>

<p>Phil took a box of matches from the mantelpiece,
and gave some to each of the boys; but
suddenly he cried, "Wait a moment: I will be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
back before you can say Jack Robinson," and ran
out of the room.</p>

<p>He went out to ask Mr. Harrison's permission
to try this experiment. Mr. Harrison said, "I
am glad, my dear boy, you have come first to me;
I believe I can always trust you. You may try
your plan, and I will go with you and join in your
amusement."</p>

<p>The boys were glad to see their teacher.
He often helped them in their plays; and they
were never afraid to frolic and laugh before him.</p>

<p>So Phil blew out the light, and then told the
boys to take a match, and wet it on the tip of
the tongue, and rub it on the sides of their faces,
and they would soon have a pair of fiery whiskers
apiece, without its burning them in the
least.</p>

<p>In a moment all the boys had flaming whiskers,
and streaks of flame all over their faces.</p>

<p>Peals of laughter resounded from all sides.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Such a troop of little blazing imps were never
seen before. Some had noses on fire, some ears;
some made fiery circles round their eyes, and
some rubbed their fingers with the matches&mdash;always
taking care to wet them first&mdash;and ran
after the rest.</p>

<p>Only one person was frightened; and that
was because she had not been let into the secret.
This was a servant girl, who opened the door,
and seeing a room full of dark figures, with faces
on fire, dancing, and laughing, and capering
about, she ran, screaming, up stairs, crying,
"Murder! Fire! Help!" with all her might,
which made the boys laugh till they were nearly
suffocated. But Phil ran after her, and with
much difficulty persuaded her that they were
really human beings, and good friends of hers.</p>

<p>After they had danced about for some time,
Mr. Harrison advised them to go and wash their
faces, and said that they had better not play this
game again, as some accident might occur: a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
match might get lighted and set fire to their
clothes. He said he had been willing to let them
try it once, for then they would not be frightened
if any wicked or thoughtless person should play
a trick of this kind upon them. So the boys put
up the matches, and went off to bed full of the
fun they had had, and saying, that if they saw a
person with his nose on fire, coming into their
rooms at night, they would take hold of it, and
give it a good pinching.</p>

<p>During this time, each of the boys had written
home for fireworks; and for two or three
days before the Fifth of November, all kinds of
boxes, directed to the different boys, had been
left at Mr. Harrison's house, and safely locked
up by him, until the right time.</p>

<p>At last the day came. The boys tumbled
out of bed in the greatest hurry, dressed, and
went out on the lawn, where they gave nine
hearty cheers; three for the day, three for Mr.
Harrison, and three for fun. After that they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
all ran into the play-room, where they found
the boxes, which had been put there the night
before.</p>

<p>Never were boxes opened so quickly. They
tore off the tops, and for some moments nothing
was heard on all sides but "Only look here," and
"Just see <em>here</em>;" "Boys, here is my cannon;"
"Here are lots of Roman candles," &amp;c.</p>

<p>They had crackers enough between them all
to keep them busy the whole day, and they soon
got to work at them, and such a popping and
cracking began, as frightened all the cats and
dogs about the house into the woods.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that the house was situated
on a hill, away from any other; so Mr. Harrison
let them make as much noise as they pleased,
without fear of disturbing any neighbours.</p>

<p>Presently the bell rang for prayers, and
directly after that they had breakfast; but the
bread and milk and honey were not so much
in favour as usual, for the boys were so full
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of the Fifth of November, that they had no time
to think of honey.</p>

<p>Nearly all the fireworks were piled up on
a seat against the wall in the play-room.
The boys were firing their crackers from their
wooden pistols, at some distance from the
house.</p>

<p>For some time everything went on well. Mr.
Harrison had strictly forbidden them to have
any fire in or near the play-room, and they were
careful to obey him. But, alas! I must tell you
what happened through the thoughtlessness of
one of the boys. He was the youngest and
smallest of them all. He had fired off the
crackers he had taken out, and he ran into the
play-room to get more. He held in his hand
a piece of punk. All boys know that this is
what they use to light their fireworks, as it
burns very slowly, and lasts very long. The
punk which the little fellow held was burning.
He had forgotten to lay it down. He went to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the seat where the fireworks were, and began
to pull them about to find his crackers.</p>

<p>As he was leaning over, the punk slipped
from his fingers, and fell into the midst of the
combustibles.</p>

<p>The little fellow was so terribly frightened at
this, that he rushed out of the room, without trying
to pick it up.</p>

<p>In a moment the fireworks all began to go off
together. Pop! crack! fizz! bang! whizz! went
the elegant wheels and the crackers, the grasshoppers,
the Roman candles and the snakes,
while the smoke rushed through the house.</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison ran out of his room where he
was reading, and saw, instantly, that the house
was in great danger of being burned down. The
boys heard the noise, and came flying back to the
play-room, to save what they could; but it was
impossible to enter. The room was black with
smoke, and they looked on dismayed, as they
heard the popping and banging of their precious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
fireworks, while "Who did it?" "Who did it?"
was asked on all sides.</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison instantly shut all the doors leading
to the play-room, and, quicker than I can tell
you, he got some pails of water, and threw them
into the room. After some effort, he succeeded
in quenching the fire, and ending this display of
fireworks, which was a very different one from
what had been intended.</p>

<p>But what a sight presented itself! There
lay the blackened remnants of the wheels and
Roman candles, and a large hole was burned in
the side of the room. The blouses of the boys,
which hung just above, were burned, some
one arm, some both; and the room looked like
desolation.</p>

<p>After the fright, and hurry, and confusion,
were over, Mr. Harrison called all the boys into
the study. He looked very much offended,
indeed; and asked in a stern voice, "Which
boy went into the play-room with fire?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
The poor little fellow who had done the
mischief was crying bitterly. It was very easy
to see that he was the guilty one, for the rest
looked grave, but not confused.</p>

<p>"Come to me, Edwin," said Mr. Harrison,
"and tell me if you have disobeyed me; don't
be afraid to speak the truth."</p>

<p>"I did not mean to do it," sobbed the little
boy. "I forgot to leave my punk outside, and I
dropped it by accident. I am very, very sorry,
Mr. Harrison. I am afraid all the boys will hate
me, because I have spoiled their sport. I hope
you will forgive me, sir." And here his tears
and sobs redoubled.</p>

<p>"Edwin," said his kind teacher, "do you not
know that my house might have been burned
to the ground by your carelessness?&mdash;and this
night, which we expected to spend so joyfully,
we might have been without a roof to cover us?
I must punish you to make you remember this
accident, which your thoughtless disobedience
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
has occasioned. You must remain in the study
until dinner-time. The rest of the boys may go
out."</p>

<p>When the boys were out on the lawn again,
they got together in a knot, to talk about the
accident. Some were very angry with Edwin,
and said Mr. Harrison ought to have given him
a tremendous flogging; but others were more
generous. They were just as sorry for the loss
of their fireworks; but, when they looked towards
the house, and saw little Edwin gazing
mournfully at them from the study window, and
wiping away the tears that fell from his eyes,
they were more sorry for him, and wished that
he could be out among them. Still, they knew
it was right that he should be punished.</p>

<p>"Come, boys," said Phil, when they had been
standing there talking some time,&mdash;"come, let us
go and see if anything is left."</p>

<p>They all ran to the play-room, and some of
the boys cried out to Edwin,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
"Don't cry, little fellow; we forgive you."</p>

<p>"Why here," shouted Phil&mdash;"here's a lot of
Roman candles all safe and sound. Hurrah!"</p>

<p>"And here are six wheels in this corner,"
cried Thomas. "We are not so badly off, after
all."</p>

<p>The boys at this good news began to rummage
under the pile of ruins, and managed to
collect quite a respectable quantity of fireworks.
There were enough left to make a display with
in the evening, though not near so splendid as
they had intended.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried the boys, "we have plenty
of Fifth of November left."</p>

<p>"I have lots of crackers outside," said Phil;
"but we won't fire them off now. They will do
for the small boys to-night. Let us go to the
stable, and pay our respects to Napoleon, and
Old Pudding-head. They will think themselves
quite neglected on this glorious occasion."</p>

<p>So they sallied off to the stable, and saddled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the pony and the donkey, and led them out to
the play-ground, where Napoleon treated them
in turn to a very fine dance on his hind-legs,
and Old Pudding-head, not to be behindhand in
politeness, gave all the little boys a somersault
over his nose. They had a first-rate frolic, and
did not think once of the lost fireworks.</p>

<p>After dinner&mdash;and a fine dinner they had of
chickens, and goose-pie, and custard&mdash;Mr. Harrison
took the boys (little Edwin, too) down into
the village, where a band of musicians were
playing and parading through the street. Every
little while they would stop playing and hurrah!
The boys always hurrahed when the band did,
for boys in general are not slow about making a
noise. So they made all the noise they possibly
could, and came back to tea, each one so hoarse,
that Mrs. Harrison asked them if they had frogs
in their throats.</p>

<p>At last the evening came, and a still and
beautiful evening it was. The stars peeped out,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
one by one, and the moon stayed in&mdash;that is, she
did not make her appearance until very late.
They could not have had a finer night for the
grand display.</p>

<p>The family were all assembled on the lawn,
and Mr. Harrison fixed the wheels so nicely, that
they whizzed round in the most astonishing
manner. The Roman candles went up beautifully,
and the grasshoppers and snakes sent the
little fellows laughing and scampering in all
directions.</p>

<p>The hurrahing was tremendous, and the
shouts of laughter were tremendous too.</p>

<p>Altogether they had a very nice time, and
went off to bed tired, it is true, but highly
pleased with their day's enjoyment&mdash;all except
little Edwin. He sighed many times, and could
hardly get to sleep; but his carelessness was a
good lesson to him, for it afterwards made him
the most careful boy in the school.</p>

<p>After the Fifth of November, the boys settled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
down into their usual employments. Their gardens
were carefully tended, and many a fine
bouquet of flowers was presented with pride and
pleasure to Mrs. Harrison. They ate pumpkin-pie,
made with their own pumpkins, and thought
them the most delicious pumpkins that ever
grew; and their melons were the sweetest melons
they ever tasted in all their lives.</p>

<p>They were very attentive in school also; and
at the end of the term, when the boys were preparing
to go home for the holidays, they all said
it was the pleasantest time they had ever spent
together. They parted with their kind teacher
with many thanks for his kindness, and hopes
that after the holidays all would meet together
again, and be as happy as before.</p>



<div class="new-h2"></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="THE_CHRISTMAS_PARTY">THE CHRISTMAS PARTY.</a></h2>


<p>Mr. and Mrs. Percy had seven grandchildren,
all very pretty and very good. These children
did not all have the same father and mother&mdash;that
is, Mr. and Mrs. Percy's eldest son had
three children, whose names were Mary, and
Carry, and Thomas; and one of their daughters
was married, and had three children&mdash;their
names were Willy, and Bella, and Fanny; and
their youngest son was married and had one
child. Her name was Sarah. She was the
youngest of the children, and they all loved her
very much, and her Grandma made a great pet
of her.</p>

<p>The children and their parents had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
invited to eat a Christmas dinner with their
Grandma, and they had been promised a little
dance in the evening. Even little Sarah was to
go, and stay to the ball, as she called it. They
were glad, for they liked to go to their dear
Grandma's very much.</p>

<p>At last Christmas came. It was a bright,
frosty day; the icicles that hung from the iron
railing, sparkled as the sun shone upon them,
and the little boys in the streets made sliding
ponds of the gutters, and did not mind a bit when
they came down on their backs, but jumped up
and tried it again; and a great many people
were hurrying along with large turkeys to cook
for their Christmas dinner, and everybody looked
very happy indeed.</p>

<p>After these children, about whom I am telling
you, came back from church, they were dressed
very nicely, and although they lived in three different
houses, they all got to their Grandma's
very nearly at the same time. The first thing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
they did was to run up to their Grandma, and wish
her a merry Christmas, and kiss her, and say
that they hoped she felt quite well. Then they
did the same to their Grandpa and Aunties, for
they had two dear, kind aunts, who lived with
their Grandparents. Then they all hugged and
kissed each other, and jumped about so much,
that some kissed noses and some kissed chins,
and little Sarah was almost crazy with delight,
for she had never been to so large a party
before.</p>

<p>"Grandma," said Willy, "I hung up my
stocking last night, and what do you think I got
in it?"</p>

<p>His Grandma guessed that he got a birch-rod.</p>

<p>"No," said Willy, laughing, "I got a doughnut
in the shape of a monkey with a long tail;
I ate the monkey for my breakfast, and it was
very good indeed."</p>

<p>The children all laughed at this, and Bella,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Willy's sister, who was the oldest of all the children,
said she thought Willy had a monkey-<em>look</em>
about him. So he went by the name of the
monkey-eater for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Soon the bell rang for dinner, and they all
went down stairs; for the children and grown
people were to dine together. It was now quite
dark, and the chandelier that hung over the
table was lighted, the curtains were drawn close,
the fire burnt brightly, and the table-cloth was
so white and fine that it looked like satin.</p>

<p>The happy party sat down at a large round
table, and the children's eyes looked so bright
and their cheeks so rosy, that it was the pleasantest
sight in the world to see. Little Sarah
could not help having a great many little laughs
all to herself. She could not keep them in. She
was only four years old, so you may suppose she
could not look very grave and stiff on such a
delightful occasion.</p>

<p>When Willy saw his little cousin Sarah trying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to hide her sparkling eyes, and her funny little
laugh behind her mother's arm, he felt just as if
somebody was tickling him. So he pinched his
lips together very tight indeed, and casting his
eyes up to the ceiling, tried to look as grave
as a judge. But it would not do; he burst out
into such a fit of laughing, that everybody else
laughed too, and it was a long time before they
could get their faces straight enough to eat their
dinner.</p>

<p>Would you like to know what they had for
dinner? Well, I will tell you. After their
Grandpa had asked a blessing, they had some
very nice soup. The children did not care for
soup. Then they had a fish stuffed with all sorts
of things, and stewed, and the grown people said
the fish was very nice; but the little ones did not
care for that either. They then had some roast
beef and a boiled turkey with oysters. The children
all took turkey; Willy asked for a drum-stick,
and his cousin Mary said he wanted it to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
beat the monkey he ate in the morning. Bella
chose a merry-thought; little Sarah liked a hug-me-fast;
Carry took a wishing-bone; Thomas
said he would have the other drum-stick to help
beat the monkey, and Fanny thanked her Grandma
for a wing, so that she could fly away when
the beating of the monkey took place.</p>

<p>But this was not half the good things, for
they afterwards had some delicious game, such as
partridges, and woodcocks, and some fried oysters.
All this pleased the grown people most. The
children saved their appetites for the dessert.
Well, after this, the cloth was taken off, and
under that was another table-cloth just as white
and fine as the first.</p>

<p>Then came something that was quite astonishing.
What do you think it was? It was a great
plum-pudding all on fire! it blazed away terribly,
and Willy thought they had better send for the
fire-engines to put it out; but it was blown out
very easily, and the children each had a very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
small piece, because it was too rich to eat much
of, and their parents did not wish to make them
ill.</p>

<p>After that there came ice-creams, and jellies,
and sweetmeats, that were perfectly delicious;
and then the other white cloth was taken off, and
under that was a beautiful red one. Then the
servants put on the table what the children liked
best of all, and that was a dish of fine motto-kisses,
and oranges, and grapes, and other nice
fine fruits.</p>

<p>The children sent the mottoes to each other,
and had a great deal of sport. Some one sent
Willy this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O William, William, 'tis quite plain to see<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That all your life you will a monkey be."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He thought his cousin Mary had sent it, because
he saw that she was trying very hard to look
grave, so he sent this to her:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Dear Mary, you are too severe&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">You are too bad, I do declare;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Your motto has upset me quite,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I shan't get over it to-night."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mary laughed when she read it, and said she had
been just as cruel to Thomas, for she had sent
him this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The rose is red, the violet blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The grass is green and so are you."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They had a good laugh at Thomas, but as he
laughed as hard as any one, it did no harm.
Little Sarah had a great many mottoes. Her
Mamma read them to her, and it pleased her
very much. She said it was a very nice play, but
she was tired with sitting such a long time at
table, so her Mother let her slip down from her
chair.</p>

<p>Very soon all the rest got up, and went up
stairs into the drawing-room. But what was that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in the middle of the room? It seemed to be a large
table covered all over with a red cloth. What
could it be? Willy said, "Grandma, that table
looks as if something was on it;" and little
Sarah said, "Grandma, I guess Old Father
Christmas has been here."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear children," said their Grandma,
"Father Christmas has been here, and this time
he looked very much like your Grandpa. He will
be up soon, and then we will see what is on the
table."</p>

<p>Oh how the children did wish to peep! They
could not look at anything else; they danced
and jumped round the table, and were in a great
hurry for their Grandpa. In a few minutes he
came into the room, and all the children ran up
to him and said, "Dear Grandpa, do let us see
what you have got on the table."</p>

<p>He smiled, and went to the table and took
the cloth off. The children were so astonished
that they could not say a single word; the table
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
was covered with beautiful things, and under it
was something that looked like a little red-brick
house.</p>

<p>"Well," said their kind Grandpa, "my dear
children, you did not think you were going to be
treated with such a fine show as this; you may
go up to the table, and see if you can find out
who they are for." The children gathered round
the table, and Willy took from the top a fine brig
with all her sails set, and colours flying. His
eyes sparkled when he saw written on a slip of
paper which lay on the deck, these words;
"For my dear Willy." The children clapped
their hands, and nothing was heard, but "How
beautiful!" "What a fine ship!" "It is a
brig of war," said Willy: "only look at the
little brass guns on her deck! Thank you, thank
you, dear Grandpa. What is the name of my
ship?"</p>

<p>"Her name is painted on her stern," said his
Grandpa. Willy looked, and saw that she was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
called the "Louisa." He blushed, and looked
very funny, and the other children laughed, for
Willy knew a very pretty little girl whose name
was Louisa, and he liked her very much; and
that was what made them laugh when they heard
the name.</p>

<p>After they had all admired the brig, they
went back to the table, and there were two beautiful
books, full of engravings or pictures, one for
Bella and one for Mary; and next to these was a
large wax doll for Carry, and another for Fanny.
Carry's doll was dressed in blue satin, with a
white satin hat and a lace veil, and Fanny's doll
was dressed in pink satin with a black velvet hat
and feathers&mdash;their eyes opened and shut, and
they had beautiful faces.</p>

<p>How delighted the little girls were! They
hugged their dolls to their little breasts, and
then ran to hug and kiss their Grandpa.
Carry said, "My dolly's name shall be Rose;"
and Fanny said, "My dolly's name shall be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Christmas, because I got her on Christmas-day."</p>

<p>Well I must hurry and tell you the rest, for I
am afraid my story is getting too long. Thomas
found for him a splendid menagerie, and all the
animals made noises like real animals. There
were roaring lions, and yelling tigers, and laughing
hyenas, and braying asses, and chattering
monkeys, and growling bears, and many other
wild beasts. Oh, how pleased Thomas was, and
all the children!</p>

<p>Little Sarah did nothing but jump up and
down, and say, "So many things! So many
things! I never saw so many things!"</p>

<p>But who was to have the little house under
the table, I wonder? There was a little piece
of paper sticking out of the chimney, and Sarah
pulled it out and carried it to her Grandpa. He
took her up in his arms, and read it to her.
What was written on it was, "A baby-house for
my little darling Sarah."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
"Why, I guess this must be for you," said
Grandpapa.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is for me," said the little girl; "my
name is Sarah, and it must be for me."</p>

<p>Her Grandpa put her down, and led her to
the table. He drew the little house out, and
opened it. The whole front of the house opened,
and there, inside, were two rooms; one was a
parlour, and one a bedroom. The children all
cried out, "What a fine baby-house! Look at
the centre-table, and the red velvet chairs; and
only see the elegant curtains! Oh dear! how
beautiful it is!"</p>

<p>Little Sarah did not say a word. She stood
before the baby-house with her hands stretched
out, and jumped up and down, her eyes shining
like diamonds. She was too much pleased to
speak. She looked so funny jumping up and
down all the time, that she made Willy laugh
again, and then everybody laughed.</p>

<p>At last she said, "There is a young lady sitting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
in the chair with a red sash on. I think she
wants to come out."</p>

<p>"Well, you may take her out," said her
Grandpa. So Sarah took the young lady out, and
then took up the chairs and sofa, one by one, and
smoothed the velvet, and looked at the little
clock on the mantelpiece, and opened the little
drawers of the bureau; and then putting them
down, she began to jump again.</p>

<p>There was never such a happy party before.
The children hardly wished to dance, they were
so busy looking at their presents. But after a
little while they had a very nice dance. One of
their aunts played for them; she played so well,
and kept such nice time, that it was quite a
pleasure to hear her.</p>

<p>It was now quite late, and little Sarah had
fallen fast asleep on the sofa, with the young lady
out of the baby-house clasped tight to her little
bosom. So they wrapped her up, doll and all, in
a great shawl, and the rest put on their nice
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
warm coats and cloaks; and after a great deal of
hugging and kissing, they got into the carriages
with their parents, and went home happy and
delighted.</p>

<p>Thus ended this joyful Christmas-day.</p>
